A lightweight macOS command-line utility to easily retrieve WiFi passwords from your Keychain.

## Overview

This tool provides a simple way to access stored WiFi passwords through macOS Keychain, eliminating the need to navigate through System Preferences. It was developed as a practical exercise in macOS shell scripting and to streamline access to saved network credentials.

## Features

- ðŸ”‘ Securely retrieves passwords from macOS Keychain
- ðŸ”„ Automatically detects and displays the current WiFi network password
- ðŸ“‹ Option to copy password directly to clipboard
- ðŸŽ¨ User-friendly terminal output with colour-coded messages

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ggfevans/show-wifi-password.git

# Change to project directory
cd show-wifi-password

# Make the script executable
chmod +x show-wifi-password.sh

# Optional: create a symlink for system-wide access
ln -s "$(pwd)/show-wifi-password.sh" /usr/local/bin/show-wifi-password
```

## Usage

```bash
# Show password for current WiFi network
./show-wifi-password.sh

# Show password for a specific network
./show-wifi-password.sh "My-Network-Name"

# Copy the current network's password to clipboard
./show-wifi-password.sh -c

# Display help information
./show-wifi-password.sh -h

# Show version information
./show-wifi-password.sh -v
```

## Security Considerations

This utility accesses your Keychain in a secure manner using macOS's built-in `security` command:

- macOS will prompt for your permission before accessing any stored passwords
- No passwords are stored or transmitted by this tool
- When using the clipboard option (`-c`), passwords remain in your clipboard only until overwritten

## Limitations

- **No Touch ID Integration**: The script uses the macOS `security` command which does not support Touch ID authentication. You will need to type your administrator password when prompted.
- **Password Entry Required**: Due to Keychain security requirements, you'll need to manually enter your administrator credentials each time you access a password - this is a security feature of macOS, not a bug.
- **Administrator Access**: Retrieving passwords from Keychain requires administrator privileges.

## Compatibility

Tested and verified on:
- macOS Sonoma (14.x)
- Should work on recent macOS versions (Monterey, Ventura)
