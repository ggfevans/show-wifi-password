# Code of Conduct

As the maintainer of this project, I'm committed to providing a friendly, safe environment for everyone. This is a small project, but I still care about keeping interactions positive and respectful.

## The Simple Version

* Be kind and respectful to others
* Use inclusive language
* Accept constructive feedback graciously
* Focus on the technical issues, not the person
* Remember that people volunteer their time here

Harassment, offensive comments, and other exclusionary behaviour aren't welcome. If you experience or witness this kind of behaviour, please contact me directly.

I reserve the right to remove contributions or comments that don't align with these principles, and to temporarily or permanently ban contributors who repeatedly violate them.

Let's keep this project fun and helpful for everyone!
